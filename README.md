# ArrQueue

This program pings you on dicsord to let you know about a stuck file in radarr or sonarr. This is useful because if you have fully automated them and use ombi to request, then you will never notice if a file is stuck. I recommend running it daily with systemd/cron.

Thanks to all the devs of sonarr/radarr for their hard work on the main projects, and Tom#7765 of the radarr discord for a portion of this script.
